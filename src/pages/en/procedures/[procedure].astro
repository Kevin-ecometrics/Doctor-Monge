[2. 1s] hip wear in its last stages after we have given them all the conservative treatment with injections with therapy and when there is no other option but to operate during the surgery what we do is to remove cartilage and bone from the hip and from the two components of the femur and the acetabulum and replace it normally with metallic components which are going to fulfill or replace the function of the same ones the primary recommendation for this type of surgery is pain and disability, a person can live with a disability if she or he wants it that way, but with the pain it already becomes a little less tolerable and it is when this type of surgeries is suggested more the age also is a factor to consider when yes it is certain that in many patients it is recommended to them when it is as late as possible a third age also young patients with much pain and much incapacity secondary to a wear by any cause can be done.

Regarding the knee, what we do in surgery is to remove the cartilage and part of the bone to accommodate new components that will fulfill the functions of what we remove, which is normally in the femur, in the tibia and sometimes in the patella, which is the small bone that is in front of the knee. Like all surgery, it requires good planning, several types of studies to be able to see which are the types of cuts, the type of alignment and the balancing that needs to be done in the knee so that it is stable.  \n\nIf you have any doubts or questions, do not hesitate to send us a message or call us so we can answer them.

This type of pain has two main elements, one mechanical and one chemical. The mechanical one is the fact that the hernia is crushing a structure, which in this case is the nerve root, and causing the pain. The other one is the chemical one, it is what the lesion or the herniated disc starts to secrete and those substances that it secretes start to irritate everything around it, which is usually the nerve root. To assess herniations we need two types of studies. One is X-rays, because X-rays, when we do see the bone and we do not see the herniation, we see other types of lesions that could hurt them.   \n\nThe other is magnetic resonance imaging where we see directly the discs, the roots, how free they are and how big the hernia or the disc lesion is. The great majority of herniated discs are treated conservatively, such as infiltration therapy, medications and spinal care, approximately 60 to 70 percent of herniated discs will not undergo surgery, but the others that behave badly and do not do well with conservative treatment or that meet certain criteria that make them surgical from the start, are the ones that we will operate on.

Among tendons, ligaments, the same form of the bones, the menisci, there are some structures that are called crossed ligaments, one anterior and one posterior, that is to say one that goes in front and one that goes behind. The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the most important structures is that it gives more stability to the knee. It provides almost 80-85% of stability as a primary stabilizer. What the anterior cruciate helps is so that the tibia does not go towards front and does not rotate of more, for putting it this way. A rupture of this ligament is going to cause instability in your knee, which is going to hurt the meniscus and cartilage and cause early wear and tear.   \n\nAlthough some people can do a conservative treatment depending on the injury, the great majority needs a reconstruction because it is necessary to return that function, that ligament so that that knee continues being stable and to prevent the early wear and tear.  \n\nIf you have any questions, any doubts, do not hesitate to call us or send us a message so we can help you.

What the hernia is going to do is to crush a nerve root and that nerve root is going to respond with pain, decreased effort, decreased sensitivity. While the great majority can be treated conservatively, with therapy, with analgesics, with infiltrations, some need surgery. \n\nThe surgery basically consists of removing that disguise, and to replace it by something in this case there are times that we put a box that is going to replace that space and something is put to protect that box or in other cases a disc prosthesis can be put, although it is less common in some patients can require that type of things the objective is to remove the damaged disc and to replace it by something that can maintain the space and the roots can be free. \n\nIf you have any questions do not hesitate to send us a message or call us to answer you.

One helps us for that structure and to protect it and the other is that they are also very important stabilizers in the knee. These structures can be injured and when the menisci are injured, they need to be evaluated to see if they are apt to be repaired or sutured in a special way, and the other is to remove the part of the meniscus that is not useful.
